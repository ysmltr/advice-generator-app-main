## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript Fetch API
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) for fetching random advice

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in making API requests and updating the DOM dynamically.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve the UI with animations and transitions
- Store previous advice to allow users to revisit them
- Add dark mode support

### Useful resources

- [MDN Fetch API Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) - Helped me understand API requests better.
- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Useful for designing a responsive layout.
